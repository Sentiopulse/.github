# SentioPulse
## AI-powered market sentiment analysis platform for financial markets.
SentioPulse is an open-source initiative dedicated to democratizing financial insights. Our mission is to cut through the noise of social media by using AI to provide a clear, actionable pulse on market sentiment. We solve the problem of information overload by transforming millions of posts into a simple, three-tiered signal—Bullish, Neutral, or Bearish—empowering investors with real-time, easy-to-understand data.

## Key Projects
Our ecosystem is composed of several independent services that work together to power the SentioPulse platform.
- [sentiopulse](https://github.com/Sentiopulse/sentiopulse): Next.js application providing the user dashboard, subscriptions, and real-time alerts.
- [classifier](https://github.com/Sentiopulse/classifier): The core AI engine for classifying market sentiment, topics, and trustworthiness from raw data.
- [ingestion-engine](https://github.com/Sentiopulse/ingestion-engine): Data ingestion service for fetching real-time content from social media APIs.
- [landing](https://github.com/Sentiopulse/landing): Static marketing and landing page to drive user sign-ups and engagement.
