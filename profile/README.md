# SentioPulse
## AI-powered market sentiment analysis platform for financial markets.

SentioPulse is an open-source initiative dedicated to democratizing financial insights. Our mission is to cut through the noise of social media by using AI to provide a clear, actionable pulse on market sentiment. We solve the problem of information overload by transforming millions of posts into a simple, three-tiered signal—Bullish, Neutral, or Bearish—empowering investors with real-time, easy-to-understand data.
